        <h2> JavaScript Basics </h2>
        <p> JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language.
            JavaScript is extremely popular for a variety of reasons. It is a small and 
        lightweight language allowing maximum flexibility for developers to take it in a bunch of different directions. JavaScript lives
    inside a host environment (a web browser or Node server), it can be connected to the objects of these environment to provide programmatic control over them.
    <ul>
<li><u> Variable Declaration </u> JavaScript variables are containers for storing data values
    - imagine a cup you fill with coffee, the cup holds the coffee, a variable
    holds a value. All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names. These unique names are called identifiers. var x;

</li>


<li><u> Variable Assignment</u> Assignment operators assign values to JavaScript variables - our cup can now
have coffee poured in it, giving our variable a value to hold. The = Assignment operator assign a value to a variable. varx=10;
</li>
<li>
    <u>Data Types</u> Data Types are an important concept; to be able to operate on variables you need to know the data type. There are six data types that are 
    JavaScript primitives. 
</li>
<li>
    <u> Conditionals</u> When you write a code, you want to perform different actions for different decisions- hitting code blocks based on 
        values or conditions that have been me. You can use conditional statements in your code to accomplish this. There are the following
        conditional statements: if a specified confition is true, do this to our code block; if else
        tp specify a new condition to test, if the first condition in false; else we execute this block code;

</li>
<li>
    <u>Loops</u> There are many different kinds of loops in every programming language, but they all essentially do the same thing: they will repeat an action
    some number of times. Imagine you have to run a mile, well you run around a track four times and yout stop. Thats a Loop.

</li>
<li> <u> Function</u> Functions are an encaspulation of code block. When we call our function this will run that code block. Think of it as a list of instruction.
    As an example imagine we are putting down a dek from Ikea, we open up the instruction manual and get started first we screw the legs to the table top;
    next we place the table top; next we place the table right way up. Done! We finished our instruction. Sadly there are ton more to do so lets call a function to do it over and pver again.
